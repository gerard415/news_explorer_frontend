          <p className="about__author-caption">
          After graduating with a bachelors degree in software engineering, I have since furthered my softwar
          skills, building countless of projects in Javascript, Typescript, React, Python, NodeJs, NextJs and more.
          I recently joined the TripleTen to fine-tune my tech skills. I feel so much joy and passion in creating 
          creative and problem solving applications. I am self-driven, detail-oriented, and thrive in collaborative 
          environments where I can contribute to meaningful projects. I'm eager to bring my creativity, discipline, 
          and technical skills to the world of tech.
